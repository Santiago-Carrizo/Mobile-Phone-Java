# Mobile Phone
This project is a replica of a mobile phone created using the Java [JFrame](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/JFrame.html) tool to recreate dialing numbers as well as the possibility of saving contacts.

## Software used
For this project I used [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java8.html) because is the latest and most compatible version of java to use this type of frame creation tool. This type of `Frame` has very useful classes and functions that speed up the creation of windows, buttons and menus and their customization, as well as being compatible with all operating systems, which is a great advantage over tools from other languages.

I also used `SQL` to create a local database as a method to save the contacts and a methot that can be upgraded to a online database for more users. For this I used the [Connectors 8.2.0](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) jar archive implemented with the tools of the development enviroment `Eclipse`

This project could be upgraded in the future with some more saving contacts settings and an online implementation to use more profiles and not only on localhost
